## Introduction
```
TextToChartConverter is a web application dashboard that converts your custom language to flow charts. When you type your custom code, it makes the relevant drawings according to the defined keywords.
```

### Point of View
```
Companies need visual charts to analyze the business of their newly started projects. In this way, after the project has started, when someone is involved in the project, they can see the vision and steps of the project by looking at the modeling system. All companies that want to start a new project need this modeling system to create a document in business process management notation standards.
```

### Solutions And Gains
```
In my modeling solution, the drawing will be done in the vertical plane, unlike the drawing made by the competitors in the horizontal plane. In addition, complex blocks will be closed in themselves, just like a code block. With simple keywords that reserved keys as a token, the way of modeling will be facilitated and thus confusion during modeling will be avoided.
